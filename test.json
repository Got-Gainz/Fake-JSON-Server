	  "description": "1) Attach a v-bar to the top pulley of a lat pulldown machine and hold onto the bar with a neutral grip, palms facing eachother. \n2) Sit down on the machine making sure to adjust the knee pad so that your legs are firmly locked in place.\n3) Lean your torso back slightly, finding the best angle for yourself that allows you to maximally engage your lats during the exercise. For most people this will be around 30 degrees.\n4) Next, puff out your chest and retract your shoulder blades in order to further increase lat activation.\n5) From this position, pull the bar down to your upper chest while keeping your elbows tucked in. Always focus on driving the weight downward using your elbows rather than your hands, and keep your attention on squeezing the lats at all times.\n6) Pause briefly in the fully contracted position, raise the weight back up under control, and repeat for anywhere from 5-12 reps.",
